# Sales Forecasting using ARIMA Model

This project implements a sales forecasting model using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method. The goal is to predict future sales based on historical sales data.

## Project Overview

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the historical sales data from a CSV file, preprocess it, and transform it into a suitable format for time series analysis.

2. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, outliers, and identify potential trends or seasonality patterns.

3. **Model Selection and Training:** Determine the appropriate order of the ARIMA model by analyzing Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots. Train the ARIMA model using training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Forecast sales using the trained ARIMA model and compare the forecasted results with actual sales from the testing dataset. Calculate forecast accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Visualization:** Visualize the actual sales, forecasted sales, and prediction intervals to provide a clear representation of the forecast's accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Venkipenki/sales-forecast-arima.git
   cd sales-forecast-arima
Install the required packages:

bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
Place your historical sales data in a file named sales_data.csv in the project directory. Make sure the data columns match those used in the provided code.

Open the sales_forecast_arima.py file and modify the code as needed, especially the column names, data preprocessing steps, and model evaluation.

Run the script:

bash

python sales_forecast_arima.py
Results and Visualization
The script will generate a plot showing the actual sales, forecasted sales, and prediction intervals. It will also print the calculated forecast accuracy metrics (MAE and RMSE) to the console.

Additional Notes
For more advanced scenarios, consider hyperparameter tuning, model diagnostics, and exploring more sophisticated time series models.
Make sure to thoroughly understand the concepts of time series analysis and ARIMA models before applying them to your specific business use case.
